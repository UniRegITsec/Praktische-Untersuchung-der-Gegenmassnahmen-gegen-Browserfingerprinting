I have based this project on **FingerprintJS** but adding some extra features out of the scope of browser fingerprinting as a PoC of how much data can be easily gathered from a client when visiting a website. You can try it [here](https://amtzespinosa.github.io/projects/fingerprinter/).

By now: 

- Aassigns a **fingerprint**
- Gets **Network Data:** IP, ISP and IP Segment
- Gets IP **Location**
- Detects the **Browser** used
- Detects the **User Agent**
- Detects the **OS**
- Detects if **Java** or **Flash** is installed
- And detects more features!
